# Micro Projects

Various little tools and utilities to place into assorted Raspberry Pis on the network. Or stand-alone app-ish things.

## Hoarder Util (h-util)

Moved to [own project](https://github.com/Perugia-Viewer/Hoarder-Util)

## Slides

Host a service that collects images from a chosen directory and broadcasts them out for viewing. Intended to operate as a digital picture frame type scenario.

Supports:

- Exif reading
- Mapbox API for GPS data
- Shuffling data
- Scanning directories

Eventually received a lot of edits to make it work more like a slide viewer, which probably caused some mess.

## Slideshow

Slide show viewer for family picture viewing.

## Streamer

Small test for a media streaming application _Aqua+_. This is the server-side project created to experiment with uploads and media.

## Streamer-client

Client-side project from the streaming application _Aqua+_. Created to experiment with `preact`.

## Muzaque Parser

Small test application to experiment with Tauri and building a compiled front-end.

Parses a library XML exported from iTunes/Apple Music, and displays basic aggregated library info via charts and pie graphs.

## Utilities

Pre-H-util project that's hosted somewhere and offers a small UI to perform various utility tasks.

Supports:

- Prefixing image names by their creation date
- Downloading and tagging youtube videos
- Migrating files

Has its own barebones front-end to handle user activity when connecting to the server.
