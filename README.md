# Micro Projects

Various little tools and utilities to place into assorted Raspberry Pis on the network. Or stand-alone app-ish things.

## Slides

Host a service that collects images from a chosen directory and broadcasts them out for viewing. Intended to operate as a digital picture frame type scenario.

Supports:

- Exif reading
- Mapbox API for GPS data
- Shuffling data
- Scanning directories

Eventually received a lot of edits to make it work more like a slide viewer, which probably caused some mess.

## Utilities

Pre-H-util project that's hosted somewhere and offers a small UI to perform various utility tasks.

Supports:

- Prefixing image names by their creation date
- Downloading and tagging youtube videos
- Migrating files

Has its own barebones front-end to handle user activity when connecting to the server.
