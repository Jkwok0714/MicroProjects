# H-util-cli

Turns some common data operations into a CLI tool, to prevent needing various third party apps and utilities and configs.

## Usage

To link the command to be able to run it from terminal globally, run:

```
npm run update
h-util -o nihao
```

If already built and just needs installation:

```
npm run local
```
