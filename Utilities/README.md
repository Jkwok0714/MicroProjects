# Overview

Just a custom tool I put on a Raspberry Pi to run common tasks I used to use Windows utilities for.

Don't really care about it that much except if it does what I need it to.

# Tasks

- *Youtube Download*: Just download some youtube files, with a format option if HD is needed or the video is more of a podcast. Powered by master YOUTUBE-DL.
- *Migrate*: By default, hook up to migrate downloaded YT videos to a network location for viewing
- *Rename*: By default, rename some images by their exif or modofy date because iOS pictures suck and are just IMG_6416.jpg with no date tag.

# Other Dependencies
Use package manager to ensure:
- CMAKE
- GCC
- ffmpeg (?)
